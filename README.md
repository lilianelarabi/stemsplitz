- **B2C:** Subscription app for personalized training (fitness + injury prevention).  
- **B2B Licensing:**  
  - **Sports academies & clinics** → bulk licenses for athletes & patients.  
  - **Universities** → integration into exercise science curriculums & AI research labs.  
- **Data-as-a-Service:** anonymized training & rehab data for sports analytics or health research.
